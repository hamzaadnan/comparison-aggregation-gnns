# A Comparison of Various Aggregation Schemes in the Context of Graph Neural Networks

## Abstract
This project gives an outline of theoretical results that establish the superiority of summa-
tion based aggregation functions and asks the question of whether this is always the case, i.e.
when are max aggregators more powerful than sum aggregators?. Randomly generated Erdos-
Renyi graphs and a popular real dataset on enzyme classification are proposed as tests.
Finally, some reasoning is provided to explain why the max aggregation scheme yields the best
performance.
